Using ETL to Collect, Import, and Process Data

## Overview

In this project, the Amazing Prime team was interested in generating an algorithm to determine which low budget films being released would be popular to the public so they can buy the streaming rights for a bargain. To do this, two data sources were required: a webscrape from Wikipedia of films from 1990 and rating data from the Movielens website. This project required extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it into one clean table, and loading it into a SQL table.
